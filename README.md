# ATM Machine Project

This project simulates the functionality of an ATM. It is designed to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

## Tasks

1. **Create ATM Class:**
   - Implement a class to represent the ATM.

2. **User Interface Design:**
   - Design the user interface for the ATM, incorporating options like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

3. **Implement ATM Methods:**
   - Develop methods for each operation:
      - `withdraw(amount)`
      - `deposit(amount)`
      - `checkBalance()`

4. **User's Bank Account Class:**
   - Create a class representing the user's bank account, storing the account balance.

5. **Connect ATM with Bank Account:**
   - Establish a connection between the ATM class and the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure it falls within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).

7. **User Feedback:**
   - Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Compile and run the ATM program.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform banking operations.
